## HL7toCSV
Simple python script to convert HL7 datastructure to CSV files! Is easy to read and understand and can be used with API's for further use with other software solutions.


The Hl7 parser was used to parse the Hl7 segments and message.
Please be aware that, the data was structured according to my needs. So, if it does not meet your requirements
feel free to restructure.

Thank you :) 

## Requirements

You need to install Python 3 and hl7apy

You can run:
``` make setup ``` 
this will setup the environment and install the hl7apy library

## How to run

Pleas use terminal to enter the input of your hl7 file and your desire csv file name.

``` python parser_1.py <input.hl7> <output.csv> ```

This will create the csv file.
